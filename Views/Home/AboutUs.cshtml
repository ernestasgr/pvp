            <p>Welcome to Green Programming Awareness!
            </br>
            </br>
            We are a non-profit organization of six Kaunas University of Technology students dedicated to helping people become aware of the environmental impact of their programming decisions. Our goal is to help developers make informed and environmentally responsible choices when writing and deploying software.
            </br>
            We believe that developers have a responsibility to be mindful of their programming decisions and the potential impacts they may have on our environment. By providing resources, education and advocacy, we hope to empower developers to make more sustainable programming decisions.
            </br>
            </br>
            We offer a range of resources to help developers become more aware of the environmental impacts of their programming decisions. Our website includes educational articles, tutorials and case studies, as well as information on current initiatives and events.
            </br>
            </br>
            We strive to foster an open and collaborative environment, and we welcome anyone who is passionate about green programming and sustainability. Together, we can make a difference and help create a healthier environment for everyone.
            </br>
            </br>
            Thank you for visiting our website and for learning more about Green Programming Awareness. We look forward to working with you!
